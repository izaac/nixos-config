# --- Security & Secrets (CRITICAL) ---
# Never commit environment files containing keys (like Gemini/OpenAI)

# History files (Shell/REPL history often contains secrets)
.bash_history
.zsh_history

# --- Home Manager & NixOS Backups ---
# You set 'backupFileExtension = "backup"' in flake.nix.
# We don't want these cluttering the repo.

# --- Editor Junk ---
# Vim/Neovim (LazyVim)
*.swp
*.swo
.netrwhist

# VS Code (User Settings)
.vscode/
!.vscode/extensions.json

# --- Language Specific Junk (Based on your dev.nix) ---
# Node.js
node_modules/
npm-debug.log

# Rust
target/
Cargo.lock # Keep this ONLY if you are building a specific Rust app here. For a config repo, it's usually noise.

# NOTE: Usually you COMMIT .envrc, but IGNORE the .env file it loads.
